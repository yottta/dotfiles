#### SOLUTION 1
Since you are unable to boot Windows after installing Ubuntu, I would suggest you to try rebuilding BCD file and see if that helps.

Create a bootable media and boot the PC using the media.

On the Install Windows screen, select Next > Repair your computer.

On the System Recovery Options screen, select Troubleshoot> Advanced options > Command Prompt.

Now type in the commands and hit enter: BOOTREC /FIXMBR
BOOTREC /FIXBOOT
BOOTREC /scanos
BOOTREC /rebuildbcd

Restart the PC.

Try running Boot Repair by Ubuntu and see if that helps. Refer the article Boot-Repair
